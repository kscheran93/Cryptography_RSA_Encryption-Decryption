# Cryptography_RSA_Encryption-Decryption
This is a Cryptography Practise Activity to generate the popular asymmetric (public key) cryptography algorithms. 

In this practice activity, I have applied my knowledge of public key cryptography to securely transmit sensitive information from your company to a business partner. You will first generate a private/public key. You will then encrypt some text using the public key of your business partner and subsequently decrypt it
(acting as the business partner) using the private key.
RSA (Rivest – Shamir – Adleman) is one of the most popular asymmetric (public key) cryptographic algorithms.
RSA supports several different key sizes including 1024, 2048 and 4096 bits

# Activity Step 1: 
I have generated a 1024-bit private/public key pair based on RSA and saved both private and public keys. Our business partner normally performs this, who will share the public key with our company.

# Activity Step 2:
I have encrypted the confidential text using the public key and saved the generated ciphertext.

# Activity Step 3:
now, I have acted as the business partner and decrypted the ciphertext that I generated in Step 2 using the private key and verified the original text.
